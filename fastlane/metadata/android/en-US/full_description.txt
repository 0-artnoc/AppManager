<i>App Manager</i> began by merging the features of <i>App_packages Info</i> (formerly <i>Application Info</i>), <i>ClassyShark3xodus</i>, <i>Activity Launcher</i> and <i>Watt</i> into a single app with material design and dark mode to give a modern look and feel.

...and other minor features such as uninstalling/enabling/disabling apps, displaying app installation info, opening on F-Droid or Aurora Droid.

It basically combined the features of five or six apps that any tech-savy person is needed to install in order to have a “life”.

See the about section within the app for more information on how to use the app.

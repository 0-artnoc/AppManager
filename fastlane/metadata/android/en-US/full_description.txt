Yet another android package manager and viewer, but...

- It is free and open source
- It has material design (and a nice UI)
- It doesn't have any useless permissions
- It doesn't connect to the internet
- It tries to display as much information as possible in the main window
- It lists activities, broadcast receivers, services, providers, permissions, signatures, shared libraries, etc. of any app
- It can launch (exportable) activities, create (customizable) shortcuts
- Using Intent Firewall, it can block any activities, receivers or services you like (requires root)
- It can scan for trackers in apps and list (all or only) tracking classes (and their code dump)
- It can generate dynamic manifest for any app
- It displays your app usage (requires “Usage Access” permission)
- Apk files can be shared (hence the use of a provider)

...and other minor features such as uninstalling apks, displaying app installation info, opening on F-Droid or Aurora Droid.

It basically combined the features of five or six apps that any tech-savy needed to install in order to have a “life”.

See the about section within the app for more information on how to use the app.

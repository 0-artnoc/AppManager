# App Manager

Yet another android package manager and viewer but...

- It is free and open source
- It has material design (and a nice UI)
- It doesn't have any useless permissions
- It doesn't connect to the internet
- It tries to display as much information as possible in the main window
- It lists activities, broadcast receivers, services, providers, permissions, signatures, shared libraries, etc. of any app
- It can launch (exportable) activities, create (customizable) shortcuts
- It can block any activities, broadcast receivers, services or providers you like with Watt and Blocker import support (requires root)
- It can revoke permissions that are considered dangerous (requires root)
- It can disable app ops that are considered dangerous (requires root)
- It can scan for trackers in apps and list (all or only) tracking classes (and their code dump)
- It can generate dynamic manifest for any app
- It can be used to view/edit/delete shared preferences of any app (requires root)
- It displays running processes/apps (requires root)
- It displays your app usage, data usage and app storage info (requires “Usage Access” permission)
- Apk files can be shared (hence the use of a provider)
- It can be used to clear app data or app cache (requires root)

...and other minor features such as uninstalling/enabling/disabling apps, displaying app installation info, opening on F-Droid or Aurora Droid.

It basically combined the features of five or six apps that any tech-savy person is needed to install in order to have a “life”.
